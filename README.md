# About-Me

    ME
I am a crazy curious guy. <br> 
I like to work on big projects and ideas.

Also have worked with (but not proficient) MATLAB, SQL, MongoDB etc. <br>
Have spent a considerable time on Linux. Though by no means I am wizard at bash, it falls in my comfort zone.

    Random Tid-bits
I went to Singapore on cultural Exchange Program, and loved every second of it. We later hosted the delegation from Singapore. <br>
I am one of weird guys who are both Maths and Languages Nerd ;) <br>
I also like Quizzing, it is one of another ways I try to find out underlying ideas among seemingly disparate things. <br>
In addition, I am bookworm, likes to solve puzzles and plays Chess occasionally. <br>

    Old Projects Update
This is my newest shiny GitHub Profile. <br>
